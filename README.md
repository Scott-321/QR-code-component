This was my first project on Frontend Mentor.

The challenge - To build out a QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process
I studied the instuctions and designs before planning how I was going to tackle to project.  As the layout was centred on the x and y-axis, I decided to go with flexbox to position the elements.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development
I've been learning HTML and CSS online for a few months now and I was excited to tackle a small project on my own. It was good to get stuck in and think for myself rather than following along to a tutorial.
I am looking forward to using more Flexbox features in my future projects. 
Although my use of variables was basic, I can see their potential when it comes to creating custom properties.
