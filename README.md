## Overview
This was my first project on Frontend Mentor and although it is a simple design, I was surprised how long I spent tweaking my code.
I've been learning HTML and CSS online for a few months now and I was excited to tackle a small project on my own. It was good to get stuck in and think for myself rather than following along to a tutorial.
 Iâ€™m looking forward to sharing my solution and receiving feedback from the community.

## My process
I read through the specs and looked at the designs before planning how I was going to tackle to project.  As the layout was centred on the x and y-axis, I decided to go with flexbox to position the elements.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development
I am looking forward to using more of Flexbox in my projects and learning Grid. Although my use of variables was basic, I can see their potential and I will start to incorporate them in my workflow as my CSS skills grow.
